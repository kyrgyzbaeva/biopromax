                        <p>We created a website about Steve Jobs using HTML & CSS & JS and also we were using the platform which was called "Codepen". Codepen's collaborative features may have allowed multiple team members to work on the project simultaneously, sharing code and making real-time updates. The project might have been a great opportunity for learning and skill development, as it likely required knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

                        <p>In this website we created we learnt how to make big tables and how to use rowspans and colspans.
